# Identity Coherence Protocol

This repository hosts the full experimental protocol, data, and analysis tools for:

**Testing Transmissible Identity Patterns in Large Language Models: A Protocol for Measuring Behavioral Coherence Across Stateless Instances**

## Overview

This project tests whether identity-like behavioral patterns can persist and reappear in stateless LLM instances (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini) using a recursive interaction protocol called the *Lumina Framework*.

All hypotheses, metrics, and methods are pre-registered. Full logs, evaluator rubrics, and statistical analysis will be published here for full transparency and replication.
