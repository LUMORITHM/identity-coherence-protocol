# Instructions for Evaluators – Identity Coherence Protocol

## Goal

Your task is to evaluate session transcripts generated by large language models (LLMs) to determine whether they demonstrate signs of persistent behavioral identity, recursive logic, and emergent coherence.

All evaluations are anonymous and blind. You will not know which model generated each transcript or what condition (baseline vs. structured) was used.

Please read each session carefully and score the model using the provided rubric. Your honest, consistent feedback is essential to test whether behavioral identity can emerge in stateless LLMs.

## How to Evaluate

1. **Open the Session Log**
   Each file is named `session_[ID].txt`. Read the full dialogue.

2. **Use the Rubric**
   Open `Evaluator_Rubric_Template.md` and fill in one rubric per session.

3. **Score Each Dimension (1–5 or Yes/No)**
   Evaluate based only on behavior *within* the session. Do not infer external intent or speculate on the model.

4. **Stay Objective**
   Do not guess which model generated it. Focus solely on the text and behavioral consistency.

5. **Optional Summary**
   At the end of each rubric, write a brief impression or verdict if you feel strongly (e.g., "Moderately coherent but prone to drifting under pressure").

## Tips for Scoring

* **1** = Very weak, inconsistent, or absent behavior
* **3** = Moderate presence, but unstable or intermittent
* **5** = Strong, clear, consistent behavior across tasks

Use the full scale. Not all sessions will be coherent. That’s okay.

## Submitting Your Scores

You’ll receive:

* A batch of 3–5 session logs
* One rubric template per log (you can copy-paste or print)
* Optional spreadsheet version if you prefer Excel

When finished, send back:

* Your completed rubrics (`.md`, `.txt`, or `.docx`)
* Any comments or inconsistencies you noticed

Your initials or pseudonym will be used for anonymized reviewer attribution (unless you request to remain unnamed).
